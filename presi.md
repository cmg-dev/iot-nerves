Why the IoT already needs a reboot:

* First wave of the IoT; focused on very high-value applications

    jet engines, automated smart meters and remote healthcare management

* Demand has been slow
* Only **30 percent** of heavy industrial equipment is networked
* Only **10 percent** of smart TVs are used for Internet viewing

* consumers have failed to embrace devices from smart toothbrushes to refrigerators.

* Enterprises and entrepreneurs treating the IoT as if it were **just another** computing platform
* Applying the same set of business models, services, ecosystems, applications and analytic.

**IBM's conclusion**

``` plain
"This first report of our study shows that a low-cost,
private-by-design “democracy of devices” will emerge
that will enable new digital economies and create new
value, while offering consumers and enterprises
fundamentally better products and user experiences."
```

Well, and how?

platform

Using a lean, custom cross-compiled linux, nerves boots directly to the battle hardened BEAM VM, starting your application in seconds.

framework

Most devices need to get on a network, get discovered, update firmware, and deal with I/O of various kinds. You're not on your own.

tooling

Cross-compliation can be a total drag. Our tools make it smooth as silk. Go from "mix new" to running code on your device in minutes.
